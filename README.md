#javascript_checkers

This is a checkers web application that works on modern browsers which was an assignment for my internet programming class. It utilized only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I learned a lot about how JavaScript can dynamically interact with HTML and CSS which helped my understanding of the way I would want to make effective use of the div tag.
